	<h1>My favorite movie: Nerve</h1>
	
	<p> My favorite movie is Nerve because I think it accurately represents our generation. The game Nerve is addicting like Pokemon Go, where people will do crazy things to get money. In Pokemon Go, many incidents have been reported such as death, and getting lost. Nerve is a technology-obsessed movie. </p>
	
	<p> My favorite actress is Emma Roberts because she plays Chanel Oberlin in Scream Queens, and Scream Queens is one of my favorite TV shows. I think she can adjust to roles really well since her character in Nerve and her character in Scream Queens are almost two characters with opposite personalities. </p>
