	<h1>My favorite movie: Nerve</h1>

	<h2>Favorite movie</h2>
	<p> My favorite movie is Nerve because I think it accurately represents our generation and how dependent we are on technology. The game Nerve is addicting; People accept reckless dares, like reaching 60 MPH on a motorcycle (blindfolded) for money. Nerve is a technology-obsessed movie. </p>
	
	<h2>Favorite actress</h2>
	<p> My favorite actress is Emma Roberts because she plays Chanel Oberlin in Scream Queens, and Scream Queens is one of my favorite TV shows. I think she can adjust to roles really well since her character in Nerve and her character in Scream Queens are almost two characters with opposite personalities. Emma Roberts has been in movies and TV shows with Ariana Grande, Lea Michelle, Dave Franco, and Machine Gun Kelly to name a few</p>
