		<h2>Personal Interest Content</h2>
		<p>My hobby is dancing. I enjoy it because it's a way for your body to express your emotions when words can't quite describe what you're feeling. The most exciting and stressful part of dance is competitions, where you perform your dance for 3-5 judges and the hundreds of people watching. However, my favorite part is getting ready for competitions; Bright colored lipsticks, smokey eyeshadows, the backstage dressing rooms become filled with chaos as dancers run back and forth, perfecting their costume, hair and make-up. Dance is not just a hobby, it's a passion. You work hard and push yourself to the best you can be and in returh, your hard-work is rewarded with achievements and trophies. </p>
